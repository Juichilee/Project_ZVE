# Space-Lotus

# General Guidelines (Recommended by GitHub Assignment Doc)
* Commits to main branch should require pull requests
* Always pull the latest code *before making changes* and *before pushing*
* Each Team Member should have an individual scene file to work on
* If there is a merge conflict with your local scene and a scene in remote and you cannot pull the latest changes...
    1. Copy your current scene file and save it in a different location outside the repo
    2. Abort merge with the command 'git merge --abort'
    3. Revert to last known good commit without merge conflicts using 'git log' and then 'git reset <commit_id> --hard'
